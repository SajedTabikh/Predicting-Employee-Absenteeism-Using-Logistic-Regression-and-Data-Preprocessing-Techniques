# Predicting Employee Absenteeism Using Logistic Regression and Data Preprocessing Techniques

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a predictive model to analyze and understand the patterns of employee absenteeism using logistic regression. By processing and analyzing absenteeism data, I aimed to identify key factors contributing to employee absences and provide actionable insights to help reduce absenteeism rates.

## Introduction

Employee absenteeism is a critical issue for organizations as it can affect productivity and operational efficiency. The primary objective of this project is to predict absenteeism patterns and identify key factors contributing to employee absences using logistic regression.

## Data Collection

The dataset includes various features such as:

- Employee demographics
- Job role
- Absenteeism reasons
- Absenteeism duration
- Other work-related factors

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing numerical features
- Balancing the dataset
- Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets

## Model Building

Using logistic regression, the predictive model was developed with the following steps:

1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Preparing the data for training
3. Building the logistic regression model
4. Training the model on the training data
5. Evaluating the model on the validation data
6. Fine-tuning the model

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- AUC-ROC

These metrics demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict employee absenteeism patterns.

## Results

The logistic regression model successfully identifies key factors contributing to employee absenteeism. These insights can help organizations develop strategies to reduce absenteeism rates, improve productivity, and enhance employee well-being.
